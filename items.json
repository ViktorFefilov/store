The pump's tongue action encourages the production of the hormones prolactin and oxytocin, thus increasing milk production and releasing it naturally and helping to create a pleasant pumping experience almost like breastfeeding.<br>The Annabella breast pump includes a soft silicone-wrapped breast shield and an adjustable size (ranging from 18 mm to 24 mm) to ensure maximum comfort during use. With 9 suction levels and 9 tongue speeds, Annabella also includes a night-time pumping light ring, making it easier for mothers to establish a pumping routine even at night. The BPA-free bottle holds up to 140 ml of milk and is safe and easy to assemble, dishwasher safe and refrigerator safe",
